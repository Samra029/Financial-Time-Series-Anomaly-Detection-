Here’s a clean and professional **GitHub repository description** you can use for your LSTM-based anomaly detection project:



### 📈 Financial Time-Series Anomaly Detection with LSTM

This project implements a deep learning-based approach to detect anomalies in stock price trends using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. It uses historical stock data from Yahoo Finance to forecast future prices and flag deviations that may indicate unusual market activity or potential manipulation.



### 🚀 Features

- 📥 Downloads historical stock price data using `yfinance`
- 📊 Calculates technical indicators (optional extension)
- 🔁 Prepares time-series data using a sliding window approach
- 🤖 Trains an LSTM model to predict next-day stock prices
- 🚨 Detects anomalies based on deviation from predicted prices
- 📉 Visualizes anomalies over time on stock price charts



### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- yfinance (for stock data)



### 📦 How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-anomaly-lstm.git
cd financial-anomaly-lstm
pip install -r requirements.txt
python lstm_anomaly_detection.py
```



### 📌 Use Cases

- Market surveillance
- Trading strategy validation
- Financial anomaly monitoring
- Academic research on time-series forecasting
